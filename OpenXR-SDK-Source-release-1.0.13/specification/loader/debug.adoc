== Loader Debugging ==

There may be times that a developer wishes to debug the loader.
The following sections define useful tips in debugging the OpenXR loader.

[[loader-logging]]
=== Loader Logging ===

The user can define the `XR_LOADER_DEBUG` environment variable which will
enable logging.
In order to use the setting, simply define the level of debug information
you wish to see logged by the loader to std::cerr.

The available log levels are as follows:

[width="60%",options="header",cols="30,70%"]
|====
| Value | Behavior
| error
    | Log any error messages that occur in the loader
| warn
    | Log any warning and error messages that occur in the loader
| info
    | Log any general information messages from the loader, as well as
    warnings and errors
| debug
    | Log any verbose debug messages from the loader, as well as
    the general information, warning, and error messages
| all
    | Log any messages originating from the loader.
|====

Notice that each level logs not only messages of it's type, but also those
of any levels above it.

[example]
.Setting XR_LOADER_DEBUG
====
*Windows*

----
set XR_LOADER_DEBUG=warn
----

*Linux*

----
export XR_LOADER_DEBUG=error
----
====

=== Additional Debug Suggestions ===

If you are seeing issues which may be related to the loader's use of either
an API layer or a runtime, there is another setting that may assist you in
tracking down problems.
Manually define the environment variable `LD_BIND_NOW` to a value of 1.
This forces every dynamic library's symbols to be fully resolved on load.
If there is a problem with either an API layer or a runtime missing symbols
on your system, enabling this will expose the problem.
When enabled, this setting causes the OpenXR loader to fail on loading the
problem library.
It is recommended that you enable `LD_BIND_NOW` along with
`XR_LOADER_DEBUG=warn` to expose any important issues.
