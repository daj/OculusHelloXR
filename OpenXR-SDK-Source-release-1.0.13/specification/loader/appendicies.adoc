=== Table of Debug Environment Variables ===

The following are all the Debug Environment Variables available for use with
the loader.
These are referenced throughout the text, but collected here for ease of
discovery.

.Debug Environment Variables

[options="header",cols="10%,30%,60%"]
|====
| Environment Variable    | Behavior   | Example Format
| <<overriding-the-default-runtime-usage, XR_RUNTIME_JSON>>
    | Force the loader to use the specific runtime JSON file.  The value
    should contain the full path to runtime JSON Manifest files.
    *NOTE:* If you fail to use the global path to a JSON file, you may encounter issues.
   a|
* `export XR_RUNTIME_JSON=<folder_a>\xr_vendor_1.json`
* `set XR_RUNTIME_JSON=<folder_a>\xr_vendor_2.json`

| <<forced-loading-of-api-layers, XR_ENABLE_API_LAYERS>>
    | Force the loader to add the given API layers to the list of Enabled API layers
    normally passed into `xrCreateInstance`.  These API layers are added after the
    implicit API layers, but before the standard explicit API layers normally added by
    `enableLayerNames` in `xrCreateInstance`.  The loader will remove any
    duplicate API layers that appear in both this list by using the first
    occurrence of any API layer.
   a|
* `export XR_ENABLE_API_LAYERS=<layer_a>:<layer_b>`
* `set XR_ENABLE_API_LAYERS=<layer_a>;<layer_b>`

| <<overriding-the-default-api-layer-paths, XR_API_LAYER_PATH>>
    | Override the loader's standard API Layer library search folders and use the
    provided delimited folders to search for API layer Manifest files.
   a|
* `export XR_API_LAYER_PATH=<path_a>:<path_b>`
* `set XR_API_LAYER_PATH=<path_a>;<pathb>`

| <<loader-debugging, XR_LOADER_DEBUG>>
   a| Enable loader debug messages.  Options are:
* error (only errors)
* warn (warnings and errors)
* info (info, warning, and errors)
* debug (debug + all before)
* all (report out all messages)
   a|
* `export XR_LOADER_DEBUG=all`
* `set XR_LOADER_DEBUG=warn`

.Glossary of Terms

[options="header",cols="25%,75%"]
|====
| Term    | Definition
| <<openxr-api-layers, API Layer>>
    | API layers are optional components that augment the OpenXR system.  They
    can intercept, evaluate, and modify existing OpenXR functions on their
    way from the application down to the hardware.
| <<openxr-call-chains,Call Chain>>
    | The sequence of calls made for a given OpenXR command.  The first
    call in a call chain is the application.  The last call in a call chain
    sequence is always the runtime function.  In between can be:
    a loader _trampoline_ function, one or more API layer functions, and a
    loader _terminator_ function.
| Core Function
    | A function that is defined in a version of OpenXR and not an extension.
    For example, `xrCreateInstance` is a core function defined in the OpenXR
    API as well as `openxr.h`.
| Discovery
    | The process the loader performs to determine the available list of
    OpenXR <<runtime-discovery, runtimes>> and <<api-layer-discovery, API layers>>.
    On Windows/Linux, the discovery process typically focuses on searching
    for Manifest files.  While on Android, the process focuses on searching
    for library files.
| Extension
    | A concept of OpenXR used to expand the core OpenXR functionality.
    Extensions may be vendor-specific, platform-specific, or more broadly
    available.  You should always query if an extension exists using
    `xrEnumerateInstanceExtensionProperties`, and enable it during `xrCreateInstance`.
| <<openxr-loader, Loader>>
    | The Khronos-developed middle-ware program which acts as the mediator
    between OpenXR applications, OpenXR API layers and OpenXR runtimes.
| Manifest Files
    | Data files in JSON format used by the desktop loader.  These files
    contain specific information for either a
    <<api-layer-manifest-file-format, API layer>> or
    <<runtime-manifest-file-format, runtime>>.
| <<openxr-runtimes, Runtime>>
    | A complete VR/XR/MR system available on a end-user's environment
    which supports one or more devices that may be used collectively.
| Terminator Function
    | The last function in the call chain before the runtime and owned by
    the loader.  Only used it a few limited cases.  Currently
    `xrCreateInstance`, `xrDestroyInstance` and `xrGetInstanceProcAddr` are
    the three primary users of a terminator.
| Trampoline Function
    | The first function in the call chain after the runtime and owned by
    the loader.
